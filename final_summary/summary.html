        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>I chose to design my page to be a website with cooking recipes. Coming into college like all other students I struggled to keep my diet in check initially and heavily on ordering out. After my first couple of semesters, realizing that my body was not in the best shape, I decided to gain control of my diet. Still, I didnâ€™t have all the time in the world to use my oven and microwave so resorted to making chicken and rice almost every day. All that changed when I purchased an air fryer. So all of these recipes include utilizing the microwave or air fryer or briefly using the oven for small things. I hope to build this website and create more recipes in the future that I can look back on and continue to add to. </p>
