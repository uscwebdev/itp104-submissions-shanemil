        <h2>Program Overview</h2>
        <p>After a lengthy quarterback battle this offseason, Ohio State coach Ryan Day announced Kyle McCord as the starting quarterback for the first game of the season against Indiana.

        </p>
        <p>McCord had been in a battle with Devin Brown as the team is looking to replace last season's starter, C.J. Stroud, who was the No. 2 selection in the NFL draft. Day had not named a starter and said as recently as last week that the players were still being evaluated.</p>
